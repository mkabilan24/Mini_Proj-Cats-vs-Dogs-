# Mini_Proj-Cats-vs-Dogs-

These are the python files which contain different models used to perform classification of Cats vs Dogs.

## Ensure that you meeet the following conditions:

1) Python version 3.11.8
2) Install tensorflow, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, pillow scikit-learn
3) The dataset is in the same directory as the pyhton files (Tip: Make sure the filename is correct!)
4) Preferably better to run these on Google Colab as better CPU/GPU resources would mean better performance


You can use the Cifar-10 dataset, the link is below!
